        <h1>Block Blast - Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Block Blast! This tutorial will guide you through the basics of the game.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>The goal of Block Blast is to clear as many rows and columns of blocks as possible by strategically placing the given block shapes onto the game board.</p>

        <h2>Placing Blocks</h2>
        <ul class="tutorial-list">
            <li>You will be presented with three different block shapes at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li>Click on a block shape to select it. A translucent version of the block will follow your cursor.</li>
            <li>Drag the selected block over the game board. Highlighted cells indicate where the block would be placed.</li>
            <li>Click on the board to place the block in the highlighted position. The block must fit entirely within the board and cannot overlap existing blocks.</li>
            <li>If you change your mind before placing, click on the selected block again (in the options area or the floating block) or click away from the board to cancel the placement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Clearing Lines</h2>
        <ul class="tutorial-list">
            <li>When a complete row or a complete column of cells is filled with blocks, that entire line will be cleared.</li>
            <li>Cleared lines disappear, and you earn points.</li>
            <li>Try to clear multiple lines at once for a higher score!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Combos</h2>
        <ul class="tutorial-list">
            <li>If you clear lines within a short period of time (a few turns), you will start a combo.</li>
            <li>The combo level will increase with each consecutive line clear.</li>
            <li>You will earn bonus points for clearing lines during a combo. The higher the combo level, the more bonus points you receive.</li>
            <li>If you don't clear any lines for a few turns, your combo will reset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Over</h2>
        <ul class="tutorial-list">
            <li>The game ends when you are given three new block shapes that cannot be placed anywhere on the game board.</li>
            <li>Your final score will be displayed.</li>
            <li>Click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul class="tutorial-list">
            <li>Plan your moves carefully! Think about how each block placement will affect future possibilities.</li>
            <li>Try to leave space for larger blocks.</li>
            <li>Focus on clearing complete lines whenever possible to maximize your score and maintain a combo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>More Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul class="tutorial-list">
            <li>Consider the shapes of all three available blocks before making a move. Sometimes it's better to wait for a more suitable piece.</li>
            <li>Empty corners can be valuable for fitting in smaller, awkward shapes later in the game.</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to create temporary single gaps if it sets you up for clearing a full line on the next turn.</li>
            <li>Think several steps ahead. How will placing this block now affect your ability to place the other available blocks?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We hope this tutorial helps you enjoy Block Blast! Have fun!</p>
